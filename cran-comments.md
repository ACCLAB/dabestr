## v0.2.3

This is a resbumission. I have reduced the tarball size by removing two vignettes,
and reduced the runtime of the examples.

This is a patch update, in response to an automated CRAN check for the upcoming 
release of ggplot2 (v3.3.0).


## Test environments
* macOS 10.15 Catalina (local install; release)
* ubuntu 18.04 (on travis-ci; release and devel)
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci; release and devel)
* win-builder (release and devel)


## R CMD check results
There are no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.


## Downstream dependencies
There is one downstream package: permubiome. 
There were no errors or issues when `devtools::revdep()` was run.
