Description: dabestr is a package for Data Analysis using Bootstrap-Coupled 
    ESTimation in R.
    Estimation statistics is a simple framework that avoids the pitfalls of 
    significance testing. It uses familiar statistical concepts: means, 
    mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the 
    effect size of one's experiment/intervention, as opposed to a false 
    dichotomy engendered by P values.
    An estimation plot has two key features:
    1. It presents all datapoints as a swarmplot, which orders each point to 
    display the underlying distribution.
    2. It presents the effect size as a bootstrap 95% confidence interval on a 
    separate but aligned axes.
